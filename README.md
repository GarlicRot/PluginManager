# PluginManager/Badge Updater

This repository contains a Python CLI tool for managing RusherHacks plugins, offering two main functionalities:

- Update Plugin Badges: Automatically fetch the latest release dates for RusherHacks plugins from GitHub and update the badges.json and README.md files with the latest information.
- Add New Plugins: Easily add a new plugin by providing the GitHub URL, description, and an optional custom plugin state (e.g., "In Development"). The tool updates the badges.json and inserts the new plugin at the appropriate position in the README.md.

This tool is designed to streamline the process of keeping plugin information up-to-date and efficiently managing the addition of new plugins.
